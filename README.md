# Get Activities

This is an app that suggests new activities to do when one is bored.

The project uses the [bored api](https://boredapi.com/api/) to get suggestions.

## Application Features

The following are the list of features currently implemented:

-   The user can click a button to get a new activity.
-   The user can filter the activities by category, and number of participants required for the activity.
-   The user can see the previous activities that were suggested in the history tab. This data persists, and remains in the application even if the website/browser is closed, or even if the user restarts the application. When the user clears the cache and localstorage of the browser, the history tab will be cleared.
-   The user can select and remove selected activities from the history tab.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
